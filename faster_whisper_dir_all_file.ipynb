            "[00:36:44,050 --> 00:36:57,060]  the top three of overseas branches on profit earnings? Which country? And what are their\n",
            "[00:36:57,060 --> 00:37:05,200]  growth rate? The top one, top two, top three. Okay. Well, last year, the top one would be Hong\n",
            "[00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:14,100]  Kong. So that top one is Hong Kong branch. Yeah. The second two would be Cambodia.\n",
            "[00:37:14,660 --> 00:37:23,070]  The second one is Cambodia. And the third place was New York. The third one is New York. And\n",
            "[00:37:23,070 --> 00:37:29,550]  I must be quite frankly that this was mainly because the very low base period due to the COVID.\n",
            "[00:37:30,460 --> 00:37:38,540]  Okay. Yeah. Their growth rate is quite significant, but a little bit skewed because\n",
            "[00:37:39,500 --> 00:37:50,460]  very low base impact for these single branches. I think it's still kind of not so fair to treat\n",
            "[00:37:50,460 --> 00:38:02,380]  them at the same level because they have different COVID impact in different timing of last year.\n",
            "[00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:13,940]  So I think we should basically treat them as a whole. That would be more fair.\n",
            "[00:38:13,940 --> 00:38:22,660]  Yeah. But in the past, actually, these three branches represent the core business in our\n",
            "[00:38:22,660 --> 00:38:30,100]  overseas model because Hong Kong represent the greater China business. And Cambodia will be the\n",
            "[00:38:30,740 --> 00:38:36,580]  core for our ASEAN markets. And the New York definitely would be the US\n",
            "[00:38:36,580 --> 00:38:44,180]  market. So these three would be pretty much a proxy model of our overseas business.\n",
            "[00:38:44,180 --> 00:38:49,390]  And also pretty diversified. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n",
            "[00:38:49,390 --> 00:38:53,150]  Diversified. One in Asia. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.\n",
            "[00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:58,350]  Greater China and Asian. And also the third one is in US.\n",
            "[00:38:58,350 --> 00:38:59,710]  Yeah. Yeah. Finish. All right. Okay.\n",
            "[00:39:00,670 --> 00:39:07,310]  Except for Cambodia, Hong Kong and the New York used to be the champion and the second place,\n",
            "[00:39:07,310 --> 00:39:13,950]  right? And then Cambodia represent the Taiwan business new hub in ASEAN countries.\n",
            "[00:39:16,480 --> 00:39:25,760]  Okay. And also we have another question from Ms. Tina Chen. Tina just mentioned that\n",
            "[00:39:26,720 --> 00:39:35,520]  any you mentioned about the credit charge, credit costs will be lower in 2023 because you have\n",
            "[00:39:35,520 --> 00:39:47,520]  higher recovery forecast. So may I know which case that you have that chance to get recovery?\n",
            "[00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:58,860]  What's your recovery amount? One prominent case is we have\n",
            "[00:39:59,740 --> 00:40:12,370]  Qingfu shipping case. All right. We have another post the collateral. And another one would be\n",
            "[00:40:12,370 --> 00:40:26,000]  another steel company, sorry, a base metal company. We recover from the collateral up to\n",
            "[00:40:28,560 --> 00:40:34,460]  more than 1.5 billion something because that collateral is quite. These two would\n",
            "[00:40:34,460 --> 00:40:48,480]  dominate. And don't forget that out of the portfolio that we have more than 50 to 60%\n",
            "[00:40:49,440 --> 00:41:10,800]  can always. Okay. Thank you. And let's go back to the final question. The first question is about\n",
            "[00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:22,220]  our dividend policy. Eric and also Lucas and also many people here. Will it be better than\n",
            "[00:41:23,490 --> 00:41:34,380]  previous year in cash dividend? Good question. We are still study how much we're going to\n",
            "[00:41:34,380 --> 00:41:47,550]  distribute this year. But the thing is that because we are now approaching our criteria\n",
            "[00:41:47,550 --> 00:41:56,020]  set up by the FSA. So after we expanded our loan book quite aggressively last year,\n",
            "[00:41:56,020 --> 00:42:21,410]  that pretty much eaten up also because of the erode. In that sense, I may not be able to be\n",
            "[00:42:21,410 --> 00:42:42,930]  so generous as before. But I must say that we will also look into the interest of shareholders\n",
            "[00:42:42,930 --> 00:42:54,300]  or investors. So we would try to maintain a more decent dividend policy. Set up a target that the\n",
            "[00:42:54,300 --> 00:43:01,440]  payout ratio will be around. Last time I would say that 60%. But now I must say that 50 to 60%.\n",
            "[00:43:02,240 --> 00:43:16,690]  And this will be this year. But a very generous dividend payout for cash now because we would\n",
            "[00:43:16,690 --> 00:43:29,650]  see that if we're going to further expand our required to reach some earnings with so that we\n",
            "[00:43:29,650 --> 00:43:43,870]  would try to avoid any potential rights issue in. Okay. So the follow up question is, is there any\n",
            "[00:43:43,870 --> 00:43:53,920]  rights issue plan in 2023 or 2024? This question is pretty much linked to how much we're going to\n",
            "[00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:02,160]  deliver, distribute our dividend this year. If we are able to adjust our dividend payout more\n",
            "[00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:09,040]  flexible, then the rights issue may not be so imminent, at least for this year. It's not in\n",
            "[00:44:09,040 --> 00:44:18,370]  the pipeline anyway. So I mean this correlation between how much we distribute our cash dividend\n",
            "[00:44:18,370 --> 00:44:31,250]  and would that lead to follow up rights issue. I must clear that we would see which would be the\n",
            "[00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:41,890]  most appropriate plan to actually secure the long term return of our shareholders and at the same\n",
            "[00:44:41,890 --> 00:44:56,270]  time not to overly dilute the shareholders value in the market. Okay. And I think we have another\n",
            "[00:44:56,270 --> 00:45:11,150]  question coming in from Mr. Liu. Okay. Mr. or Ms. Liu hopes to know what's our future strategy about\n",

            "[00:45:23,920 --> 00:45:36,990]  as the rate is high now, so how do we promote our wealth management products to these huge base\n",
            "[00:45:37,550 --> 00:45:49,070]  mortgage clients? So as we try to prolong the product duration and how do we develop the wealth\n",
            "[00:45:49,070 --> 00:45:58,510]  management business? I think we just need to, I think his question is how do we expand our wealth\n",
            "[00:45:58,510 --> 00:46:14,240]  management business in 2023? I think your question, try to link the wealth management business is a\n",
            "[00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:27,460]  bit, I mean this is, this may be a model that most of our peers did, that they tried to penetrate into\n",
            "[00:46:27,460 --> 00:46:37,780]  the mortgage borrower and then they will lift up the LTV and then to squeeze some money out of this\n",
            "[00:46:37,780 --> 00:46:49,100]  mortgage borrower and then encourage the mortgage borrower to invest. Is that what you mean? I think\n",
            "[00:46:49,100 --> 00:46:57,820]  so. I think so. Okay. Well, this is quite a common model that most of our peers would pitch like this.\n",
            "[00:46:58,460 --> 00:47:09,100]  But the truth is that now that the cost of mortgage actually went up. So if you like to lure your\n",
            "[00:47:09,100 --> 00:47:15,580]  mortgage borrower to squeeze some money that they can invest into the wealth management products,\n",
            "[00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:24,640]  one criteria must meet would be the product must offer a higher return than their mortgage cost,\n",
            "[00:47:24,640 --> 00:47:36,990]  right? So currently clients will be part of our target audience to further develop the wealth\n",
            "[00:47:36,990 --> 00:47:46,590]  management business. But we are now more interested into the high net worth customers and also let's\n",
            "[00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:58,780]  see some repatriated capital from overseas talent businesses. So I must add our model is slightly\n",
            "[00:47:58,780 --> 00:48:08,270]  different from the so-called to capture this mortgage borrower to squeeze the money out of\n",
            "[00:48:08,270 --> 00:48:16,830]  their mortgage borrowing because now their cost is higher. So we would see that our wealth management\n",
            "[00:48:16,830 --> 00:48:26,300]  model is more linked to the so-called high net worth and also some repatriated capital and also\n",
            "[00:48:26,300 --> 00:48:37,140]  the really retail clients are also our target audience. So the mortgage borrower may be just\n",
            "[00:48:37,140 --> 00:48:45,440]  part of the audience but not the main source of our wealth management business target.\n",
            "[00:48:47,180 --> 00:48:56,540]  Okay, thank you. And we have another question is about our swap gains. Can we provide\n",
            "[00:48:58,940 --> 00:49:14,980]  him the swap gains portfolio amount? So far, no, no, no, no. But I still have the swap gains.\n",
            "[00:49:14,980 --> 00:49:25,380]  But we already answered the swap gains. I must highlight that if the US rates continue to\n",
            "[00:49:26,420 --> 00:49:33,260]  move higher, maybe the swap gains would be better than that because the rate gap.\n",
            "[00:49:35,300 --> 00:49:46,100]  Okay. And we have the last question here. It's about our post-COVID, the China exposure strategy.\n",
            "[00:49:46,900 --> 00:49:54,180]  What's our post-COVID China exposure strategy given that the China has lifted all the COVID\n",
            "[00:49:54,180 --> 00:50:03,730]  restrictions after the Chinese Lunar New Year? Any? Actually, when you look back to our\n",
            "[00:50:05,280 --> 00:50:14,990]  China business, most of our China branches all booked profits last year, including Shanghai,\n",
            "[00:50:16,220 --> 00:50:29,980]  Hengdu, Xiamen, and not to mention Hong Kong. So it implies that the business opportunity\n",
            "[00:50:30,700 --> 00:50:40,690]  in the great China will gradually surface. However, we would take a more, I mean,\n",
            "[00:50:41,740 --> 00:50:55,500]  prudent manners to expand that the tension between the cross-straits still persists.\n",
            "[00:50:55,500 --> 00:51:03,420]  So we would look into some business opportunity like with the Taiwan business operated in both\n",
            "[00:51:03,420 --> 00:51:12,240]  sides and particularly focused on the supply chain business. And that would be our major\n",
            "[00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:21,440]  strategy to gradually catch up the greater China momentum, not a very proactive,\n",
            "[00:51:21,440 --> 00:51:29,840]  but a more prudent and conservative expansion plan to do the business in the greater China region.\n",
            "[00:51:31,970 --> 00:51:37,410]  Okay. Thank you, Annie. And I think we have answered all of the questions.\n",
            "[00:51:38,050 --> 00:51:45,810]  And I hope that you enjoyed today's Q&A. And if you have more questions after today's conference,\n",

            "[00:51:55,410 --> 00:52:01,570]  question on your head and you can also email us. So no need to worry. And I will\n",
            "[00:52:01,570 --> 00:52:09,840]  just turn over to Annie to have a conclusion. Okay. Maybe I can add one more thing.\n",
            "[00:52:10,400 --> 00:52:20,340]  Okay. Well, I guess most of the investors in the market will get a hit from dividend payout\n",
            "[00:52:20,340 --> 00:52:26,820]  from our peers in some bank. And I must say that our policy for First Financial would be\n",
            "[00:52:26,820 --> 00:52:35,940]  stabilize or smooth out our dividend payout, but not to have a very volatile dividend policy.\n",
            "[00:52:35,940 --> 00:52:45,060]  So that's why we would balance the whole investment return for our shareholders so that\n",
            "[00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:53,380]  they can have a more predictable dividend gains from their investment in the First Financial.\n",

            "[00:25:34,320 --> 00:25:41,790]  we have already produced 1.2 billion and it will further boost up 2.3 to 2.4 billion.\n",
            "[00:25:42,030 --> 00:25:48,270]  Which means that nearly three times currency swap was really a booster.\n",
            "[00:25:48,270 --> 00:25:54,380]  Yeah. And for next year, it will be even higher.\n",
            "[00:25:54,380 --> 00:26:00,800]  Okay. Well, let's talk about that later. And let's finish the 2022 guidance.\n",

            "[00:26:15,090 --> 00:26:22,780]  For this year, we see some more extra provision against,\n",
            "[00:26:26,060 --> 00:26:36,500]  apart from the Tokyo exposure and also some exposure or delinquent portfolio would need to be\n",
            "[00:26:37,380 --> 00:26:45,680]  further charged off. So for this year's credit cost guidance will be lifted from\n",
            "[00:26:47,140 --> 00:26:56,960]  original projection around 18 to 19 bps, 22 bps due to the extra provision.\n",

            "[00:27:03,060 --> 00:27:07,940]  All right. Okay. And let's move to the second part,\n",
            "[00:27:07,940 --> 00:27:16,580]  which is the 2023 guidance. I'd like to start with, some of you are concerned about the NIM\n",

            "[00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:57,390]  All right. Adjusted NIM compared with adjusted NIM of this year, it will be 9 to 10 bps expansion\n",
            "[00:27:57,470 --> 00:28:18,220]  projection up to 1.15%. All right. Okay. So how does a firm generate so much?\n",
            "[00:28:18,220 --> 00:28:33,040]  Talk about that. Basically, we have attracted quite a huge liquidity\n",
            "[00:28:33,600 --> 00:28:43,680]  that our US dollar's deposit grew by 24% this year. So this very ample liquidity has been\n",

            "[00:28:53,790 --> 00:29:04,750]  boost the overall swap gains. So our projection for next year's swap gains will be as high as\n",
            "[00:29:04,750 --> 00:29:15,070]  nearly $9 billion. All right. So that will help to boost the overall net interest income,\n",
            "[00:29:15,070 --> 00:29:22,910]  I mean NIM. Okay. So the lion's share of the adjusted NIM contribution will be from the\n",
            "[00:29:22,910 --> 00:29:36,510]  currency swap gains. In 2023, we projected a billion NT dollars for exciting.\n",
            "[00:29:36,990 --> 00:29:44,190]  Right. And also, can we talk about the loan growth of net?\n",
            "[00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:52,750]  When we turn back to our loan book expansion, that will be pretty much impacted by\n",
            "[00:29:53,550 --> 00:30:04,020]  the not so optimistic GDP growth that most of the analysts or government agency actually\n",
            "[00:30:04,580 --> 00:30:13,940]  revised down the GDP growth. That was less than 3% or as low as 2.5% to 2.7%.\n",
            "[00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:21,140]  So in that case, we set a target to grow our loan book by about just 5%,\n",
            "[00:30:22,420 --> 00:30:29,940]  which is to beat the GDP growth. And in terms of the composition of the loan portfolio,\n",

            "[00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:59,600]  SME lending, it will be slowed down from current nearly 7% to about 4% to 5%.\n",
            "[00:31:00,990 --> 00:31:10,030]  And when we look into the mortgage book, after it recorded a double-digit 10% to 11%\n",

            "[00:31:20,940 --> 00:31:33,100]  will impact the mortgage buyers' momentum to engage in higher lending because their financing\n",
            "[00:31:33,180 --> 00:31:41,820]  costs actually come higher. So the main growth driver will be from FX lending more than 7%,\n",
            "[00:31:42,620 --> 00:31:49,820]  and SME and mortgage book would slow down to 4% or 3%.\n",
            "[00:31:52,030 --> 00:32:01,950]  Okay, let's conclude the loan growth. The total loan book growth will be projected for 5% growth.\n",
            "[00:32:02,750 --> 00:32:11,070]  In terms of the different sectors, for SME we projected a 4% to 5% growth, and for mortgage\n",
            "[00:32:11,070 --> 00:32:19,550]  lending we projected a 3% to 4% growth. And for FX lending, which will be the highest one,\n",
            "[00:32:19,550 --> 00:32:31,180]  we projected a 7% growth for next year. And so it will be the major projection for our loan book.\n",
            "[00:32:32,020 --> 00:32:41,840]  And let's talk about the fee income revenue. Annie, talk about the fee income guidance for us.\n",
            "[00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:54,060]  Next year, the fee revenue should see moderate growth around 5% to 6% after we recorded a\n",

            "[00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:13,070]  attractive because of the sluggish markets. But next year, due to the low base period factor,\n",
            "[00:33:13,070 --> 00:33:19,390]  the wealth management fee revenue should see some decent growth up to 8% to 9%.\n",
            "[00:33:20,110 --> 00:33:31,600]  However, the loan related fee should see some setback because this year we already\n",
            "[00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:45,040]  reached 20% to 22% growth for the loan related fee, thanks to the very buoyant lending expansion.\n",
            "[00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:54,370]  So next year, based on the 5% loan growth outlook, the loan related fee should remain sluggish.\n",
            "[00:33:56,640 --> 00:34:06,960]  And another area that would help to boost the fee revenue would be for the overseas\n",

            "[00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:33,180]  how about the other financial products, other financial products, long term investment and\n",
            "[00:34:33,820 --> 00:34:49,200]  equity? Well, in fact, in fact, most analysts or trading house all projected a conservative\n",

            "[00:35:14,340 --> 00:35:25,790]  due to that the the dividend income from our core holding for the equity investment would go lower\n",
            "[00:35:25,790 --> 00:35:34,350]  because that profits from this investment target may lower their dividend payout. So that would\n",
            "[00:35:36,190 --> 00:35:48,610]  to tend to that impact our our dividend income. So apart from swap gains, other treasury\n",
            "[00:35:49,330 --> 00:35:59,440]  activities, the gains would lower next year. That was a major assumption. However, if the equity\n",
            "[00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:16,140]  market does perform better than our imagination, then maybe the treasury gains. Okay, so the basic\n",
            "[00:36:16,140 --> 00:36:32,460]  scenario is that if we exclude swap gains, that other decline next year, the swap gains still\n",
            "[00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:45,280]  brilliant growth, double digit growth, right? Because the swap gains was so far was still\n",
            "[00:36:45,760 --> 00:37:00,880]  more than four times the size that we look to this. And also, let's talk about the fee. How\n",
            "[00:37:00,880 --> 00:37:12,340]  about the operating expense? Well, for the cost front, the operating expense would grow by six\n",
            "[00:37:12,340 --> 00:37:20,660]  percent, mainly driven by the one source would be headcount cost and the other source be from\n",
            "[00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:32,290]  the increased like the purchase of green energy power and also the\n",
            "[00:37:34,050 --> 00:37:43,120]  restored travel cost and also our pay our fee paid to the deposit insurance would also be high.\n",
            "[00:37:43,120 --> 00:37:53,840]  So the six percent operating cost increase was mainly driven by driven by inflation as well.\n",
            "[00:37:54,780 --> 00:38:01,740]  And also, let's talk about the cost income ratio. Will it still be the same as this year?\n",
            "[00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:09,810]  Yeah, somewhere around 45%. This year, this year would reach about 46. Next year, 45.\n",
            "[00:38:10,370 --> 00:38:20,540]  Okay. And let's talk about the credit cost of next year. A lot of investors are concerned\n",
            "[00:38:20,540 --> 00:38:29,440]  about the credit cost. How do you first financial the credit cost of next year?\n",
            "[00:38:29,440 --> 00:38:40,560]  Next year, we still maintain a prudent provisioning strategy that post the\n",
            "[00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:53,860]  huge expansion of our loan broker. There may be some what we call it the natural influx of\n",
            "[00:38:53,860 --> 00:39:04,850]  loan portfolio. So next year, our credit cost would stay around 19 to 20 biths, just two\n",
            "[00:39:04,850 --> 00:39:15,810]  biths lower than that of this year due to the expansion of our loan book and also the portfolio\n",
            "[00:39:15,810 --> 00:39:31,250]  may also produce certain delinquent exposure so that that would not reduce our provision.\n",
            "[00:39:31,250 --> 00:39:38,850]  Next year, credit cost just slightly lower, 20 biths.\n",
            "[00:39:41,760 --> 00:39:51,280]  So the net credit cost will be 19 to 20 biths, 19 to 20 biths for next year. This is because\n",
            "[00:39:51,280 --> 00:40:06,740]  that we have had a pretty much recovery from the debt. We have had two years. And also,\n",
            "[00:40:06,740 --> 00:40:25,860]  let's talk about another part. Is there any rise issue plan for all rise?\n",
            "[00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:36,350]  Yeah. Actually, no plan for the time being because we still generate up to 9% ROE. So\n",
            "[00:40:37,230 --> 00:40:49,120]  this can finance our loan growth plan that our loan book would only advance by 5%. So an ROE of\n",
            "[00:40:49,840 --> 00:40:56,100]  9% should look decent to the asset growth.\n",
            "[00:40:57,940 --> 00:41:08,770]  Okay. And the last part is the dividend. The dividend payout policy is very, very important.\n",
            "[00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:14,000]  Can you talk about the dividend payout?\n",
            "[00:41:14,000 --> 00:41:27,390]  Well, our dividend plan should stay pretty close to what we normally do. However,\n",
            "[00:41:28,350 --> 00:41:47,920]  due to the huge jump in our loan portfolio, that actually reduced our core capital,\n",
            "[00:41:47,920 --> 00:41:56,900]  which means the CEC1 and the Tier 1. So in that sense, we would have to see\n",
            "[00:41:57,780 --> 00:42:07,940]  for next year's loan to stay what we originally projected, that less than 1%.\n",
            "[00:42:09,860 --> 00:42:14,990]  Then the dividend payout would not see some pressure that we have to retain\n",
            "[00:42:16,510 --> 00:42:22,460]  more earnings to support the loan growth. So we would see that\n",
            "[00:42:23,420 --> 00:42:36,820]  the 60% payout ratio may be a target for next year's percent.\n",
            "[00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:47,500]  Okay. 60% of cash, mainly by cash. Okay. And we have another question from Tina Chen.\n",
            "[00:42:47,500 --> 00:42:52,940]  Tina hopes to know, can we update the total loan growth for this year only?\n",
            "[00:42:53,900 --> 00:43:12,300]  Because nine months is a little bit beyond the expected.\n",
            "[00:43:12,300 --> 00:43:24,610]  For this year, we would be able to achieve nearly 11% to 12%, 11% to 12% loan growth.\n",
            "[00:43:24,610 --> 00:43:34,900]  And the main reason was driven by the hiking of U.S. dollar rate. Most clients actually arbitrage\n",
            "[00:43:34,980 --> 00:43:56,370]  to the low-cost anti-dollars. I mean, resulting higher anti-dollars LDR ratio up to 84%.\n",
            "[00:43:59,600 --> 00:44:11,550]  LDR ratio for U.S. dollars went down to less than 50%. This was partially distorted by\n",
            "[00:44:11,550 --> 00:44:21,570]  the interest rate gap between anti-dollars and U.S. dollars. This year's loan growth expansion\n",
            "[00:44:24,670 --> 00:44:29,660]  is a bit more than our prior projections.\n",
            "[00:44:29,660 --> 00:44:30,540]  All right. Okay.\n",
            "[00:44:30,540 --> 00:44:36,420]  Because this year's GDP growth was not that prominent.\n",
            "[00:44:36,420 --> 00:44:39,620]  Oh, a double-digit loan growth for this year. That's right.\n",
            "[00:44:39,620 --> 00:44:40,260]  Yeah, yeah.\n",
            "[00:44:40,260 --> 00:44:50,990]  Okay. And I think we need to catch up with some rationale behind the projection of net.\n",
            "[00:44:51,070 --> 00:45:00,750]  This is because what's the rationale behind this swap game expansion? So what does\n",
